The patient overview page is what you see when you click on a patient's name anywhere in Quickscreen. There are a few major sections to this page outlined below.

## Patient header

This is the top of every patient profile page, and gives you a brief summary of important information, including their contact information, profile photo, and Quickscreen ID.

The left sidebar is how you navigate through a patient profile.

## Referrals

This section shows all current and past referrals in one place. These show which clinic made the referral, and which clinic is receiving the referral. You can learn more about [making](/docs/make-a-referral) and [responding](/docs/respond-to-a-referral) to referrals.

## Documents & summary information

This section gives a brief summary of the patient and the necessary information required to complete a screening. All of this information is calculated from data entered in the [patient details](edit-a-patient). It also includes a list of documents that have been uploaded for the user, so you can quickly view them from here to make a decision.

## Eligibility form

If there isn't an open referral to your clinic for this patient, you should still have the opportunity to enter screening results in case they are referred in the future. This section gives you the Quickscreen estimated eligibility (based on patient details) and a form for you to enter their eligibility at your clinic.
