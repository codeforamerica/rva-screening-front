Creating a patient requires you to go through the [search](/docs/homepage-search) process in order to ensure the patient doesn't already exist in the database, and thus reduce the chance of duplicate patient entries.

To create a patient, search for their name in the homepage search. If they don't exist, you can use the blue button to create a new profile.
