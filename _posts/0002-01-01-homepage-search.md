The homepage is comprised of two parts:

1. Searching for patients and
2. Viewing categorized and organized lists of patients

### Searching for a patient

To find a patient in Quickscreen, search using their first and last name, or their date of birth or social security number. Using all four fields will improve the search results. *Note: seearch results are "fuzzy", which means results will not only be perfect matches of what you search to take name mispellings into account.*

Searching for a patient will bring you to a patient profile. You can learn more about patient pages in the [patient overview section](/docs/patient-overview).
