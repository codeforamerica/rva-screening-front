Making a referral is the primary action in Quickscreen. A referral for a patient comes from one clinic, sent to another in order to ensure a patient is or is not eligible. It provides a channel for back-and-forth communication between clinics on behalf of the patient, in order to more clearly define the requirements to recieve care at the clinic. 

In order to make a referral, navigate to a patient's profile and click the "Eligibility and Referral" navigation item. This page lists estimated eligibility and presents the user with a space to make a referral to another clinic, regardless of estimated eligibility.

Responding to a referral is a different workflow. Learn more about how to [mark a patient as eligible](/docs/respond-to-a-referral) through a referral or without a referral.
