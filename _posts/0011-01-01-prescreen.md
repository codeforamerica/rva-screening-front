The prescreener tool is used to quickly view someone's eligibility, regardless if they exist as a patient in Quickscreen or not. In order to check eligibility at services, the prescreener requires *four questions* to be answered:

1. What is your household size?
2. What is your monthly household income?
3. Do you have health insurance?
4. Are you eligible for Medicare/Medicaid?

These four questions can accurately estimate eligibility at the clinics in Quickscreen. The results will look a lot like the [estimated eligibility](/docs/estimating-eligibility) results in a patient's profile.
