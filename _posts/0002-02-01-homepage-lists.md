The homepage, which includes a [search](/docs/homepage-search) bar for patients, also has a series of lists that organize patients under similar categories to make analyzing and reviewing patients related to you and your clinic easier.

The lists are broken into two major categories:

1. patients related to **your clinic** and
2. patients related to **you** specifically

The following will go through each list and how they can be useful to you. Each patient entry in the lists is a link to that [patient's overview page](/docs/patient-overview).

* **Outgoing referrals**: these are all referrals made by users at your clinic (including yourself), sent to other clinics. This list gives you access to who sent the referral and the current status of the referral, which is either "sent" or "completed". 
* **Incoming referrals**: this is a list of all referrals that have been sent to your clinic, from any other clinic. If there are patients with "sent" status, you have the ability to screen them and complete their referral.
* **Patients with renewal notices**: a patient is added to this once their profile hasn't been edited for 11 months. This allows you to gather up-to-date patient information before they become ineligible after a year.
* **Your outgoing referrals**: this is a list of all referrals you have made and their current status
* **Your recently updated**: this is a list of patients that you have recently made changes to. This list can be helpful to refer to when working with a set of patients during the day, instead of using the search bar every time.
