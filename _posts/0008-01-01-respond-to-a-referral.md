Responding to referrals can happen via email or in-app. Anyone at your clinic can respond to incoming referrals. You have the opportunity to respond in three ways:

1. **Need more information**: this is essentially adding a comment to a referral asking for more information in order to make an accurate decision on eligbility.
2. **Eligible for services**: marking a patient as eligible and at which sliding scale (if applicable) will notify the clinic who originally made the referral so they can effectively create an appointment and confidently send a patient to your clinic.
3. **Not eligible for services**: this marks a patient as ineligble for services for the time being. This doesn't mean they won't be eligible every again, but under their current circustances they cannot recieve care at your clinic.

It is best to use the [list on the homepage](/docs/homepage-lists) to view incoming referrals.
