Every edit made on a patient's details is recorded in Quickscreen for audit and reference purposes. In order to view a patient's edit history, find their profile and select the navigation item "Edit History". You will see a table comprised of rows for each edit, and information about who made the edit, what date/time the edit was made, and what information changed.
