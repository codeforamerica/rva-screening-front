You can check any patient's estimated eligibility in Quickscreen to see which services they are eligible for, and what the price will be for each service. In order to do this, navigate to the patient's profile/overview page and click the sidebar navigation item "Eligibility and Referral". You can explore eligibility via the map or the list of services and subsequent estimations.
