Quickscreen allows you to [create a profile](/docs/create-a-patient/) for a patient and add information that is used to calculate eligibility across different clinics in Richmond, VA. Their information, once uploaded, is accessible to a network of clinics across the city to remove the need for patients to fill out the same information every time they go to clinics.

Once a patient has been created in Quickscreen, they can be [referred](/docs/make-a-referral/) to other clinics, where someone from the receiving clinic can estimate their eligibility based on a patient's profile. This allows clinics to have a conversation about a particular patient *remotely* before a patient travels to a clinic. Quickscreen provides a means for services to [confidently screen a patient](/docs/respond-to-a-referral/) before they come into the clinic. It can reduce the time for patients to get to care by speeding up the referral process once they show up, since their information is already available to the clinics.

This documentation goes throught he major actions a user can take in the app, and outlines the steps to create, update, and refer a patient to other services.
