  <p>In order to get to a health appointment at a clinic in Richmond, patients must go through a screening appointment first to ensure they meet the necessary criteria for care. This includes household size, employment and income, as well as eligibility for other services such as Medicaid. While this information is necessary, it isn't collected in a way that stays with patients, and is left behind if a patient is referred to a new clinic for different care. This results in a patient going through *another* screening appointment to get care, answering the same questions, and lengthening the time it takes to get to care.</p>

  <p>The RVA Health project is an application by the City of Richmond that allows health clinics in the city to share patient eligibility information for a single patient in order to quicken the process of screening appointments and thus shorten the time it takes to get a health appointment.</p>

  <p>This project is a collaboration between Code for America and the Richmond City Health District. We are currently in a pilot stage, testing the application amongst a small group of clinics, which includes case managers, community health workers, and social workers who have given much time and effort to make the application as user-friendly as possible.</p>
