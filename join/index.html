    <p>The City of Richmond is looking to expand the RVA Screening project to more interested individuals. Below is the step-by-step process used to evaluate and onboard health or health-related providers.</p>

<div class="container">
  <h2>1. Fill out an interest survey</h2>
  <p>The interest survey is a short, one-time set of questions that let's us quickly evaluate if your organization can use a tool like this. Upon submission someone from the city will be in contact with you within a week. You can fill out the survey <a href="#">here</a>!</p>

  <h2>2. Set up a shadowing appointment</h2>
  <p>We want to make sure this app fits your workflow in the best way possible. In order to do that, we have to see what your clinic's day-to-day operations look like. Along with shadowing appointments, we'll have your organization provide all necessary information in order to set up the account in the app. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All necessary eligibility documents and questions</li>
    <li>Complete understanding of who will be using this application</li>
    <li>Delegated point person at the service for efficient communications</li>
    <li>Understanding of patient-base</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Plan initial tests</h2>
  <p>Once we have a solid understanding of your organization's operations and who will be using the app we will set up initial tests with a couple users. This way we can judge how exactly this works into your organization's processes. This step's timeline is much more nebulous. We want to make sure the app is helping your organization's employees and patients - not acting as a burden. Here we can work around making the app perfectly fit your workflow.</p>
  
  <h2>4. Pilot the application and training</h2>
  <p>After successful initial tests we can work out any kinks and start using the application on a semi-regular basis. At this point we will have all of the users defined at the organization and will conduct a day-long training.</p>
  
  <h2>5. Independent usage</h2>
  <p>Finally, we will create and share the necessary logins/permissions for your organization to begin using the app full-time.</p>
